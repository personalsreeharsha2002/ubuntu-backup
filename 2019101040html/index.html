<p>This is my First Website. I didn't know html and css until now. But it is teaching me a lot by Googling. I am not listening in the class, but still I am doing this because of my interest towards these languages.I want to learn these languages in a detailed way and I want to make a website but now since there is no time, I am just Googling and doing.  </p>

<p>I was more interested in hacking.I will always watch the movies which have more hacking content.because in some hacking movies they will show the idea of hacking in a different in the sense good way we can hack the corrupted politicians banks and share the money to the people who are very poor.And India has many of such politicians. we can use this hacking for other purposes also but one should use in a proper way.And you should be carefull about your electronics also because as technology increasing there is more chance to leak our personal information. So you always be alert you should not go to the websites which are not secure. You should read the terms and conditions before accepting blindly when you installing an app from play store or any other stores. And be carefull of blank messages if you ignorre them they will access your microphone and record your calls and they will blackmial you so please be consious on what you do. Because <strong><em>"INFORMATOIN IS WEALTH"</em></strong>    </p>
