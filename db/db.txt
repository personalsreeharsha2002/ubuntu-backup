Why Database
	ACID - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
		Similar to the example we discussed in the class --> https://beginnersbook.com/2015/04/acid-properties-in-dbms/

	Integrity
		https://database.guide/what-is-referential-integrity/
		We also discussed about CHECKSUM (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum)

	Concurrency
		We just touchbased as multiple operations happening at the same..

	MultiUser
		
	Persistence
		Genesis of DB. Data being available in secondary storage.. It may be worth reading about SSD, Tapes, Disks. Current trend is SSD.
		Data being managed in a distributed environment..role of network can be explored.
		Storage Area Network, Network Access storage.. new concept Ceph - Software Defined Storage..
	Security
		Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
		Personally Identifiable Information
		Importance of Privacy Data Protection...act coming up in India.  GDPR is the latest European trend on privacy protection

		Data Flow diagram - Part of Functional specs activity. https://medium.com/@warren2lynch/data-flow-diagram-comprehensive-guide-with-examples-d9858387f25e
			The importance of standard notation comes up across software engineering so that multiple teams and multiple people can easily communicate.

Database Engine and Schema

SQL.. Declarative Language
	SELECT
	DDL
		CREATE
		ALTER
		
		Some basic commands
			Create TABLE Employee
(ENO INT NOT NULL,
ENAME VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
DEPTNO INT NULL,
SAL INT NOT NULL,
MGR INT NULL,
JOD DATE NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (ENO));


CREATE table DEPT
(DEPTNO INT NOT NULL,
DNAME VARCHAR(255),
PRIMARY KEY (DEPTNO));

ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_DEPT
FOREIGN KEY (DEPTNO) REFERENCES DEPT(DEPTNO);


DML
		INSERT
		UPDATE
		DELETE

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPT 
WHERE EMPLOYEE.DEPTNO = DEPT.DEPTNO;

INSERT INTO DEPT
VALUES
(10, "SERC");


INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE
(ENO, ENAME, DEPTNO, SAL, JOD)
VALUES
(1, 'LALIT', 10, 1000, '2016-01-01');


UPDATE DEPT
SET DNAME = 'SOFTWARE ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTRE'
WHERE DEPTNO = 10;


INSERT INTO DEPT
VALUES
(20, "SERC");

DELETE FROM DEPT
WHERE DEPTNO = 20;
